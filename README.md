## The ChatGPT Applications 

End-users interact with a <strong>Chat application</strong> (on the "front-end") to hold conversations with users via interactive chat.

A traditional Chat app, such as the iMessage app on iPhones between people, has a human on both ends of the conversation.

Two applications are constructed by this repo:

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708723967/openai/containers.png"><img alt="containers.png" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708723967/openai/containers.png"></a>
 
A. The "front-end" <strong>Chat app</strong> is used by humans to interact with a non-human "Docs Application".

B. The <strong>Docs app</strong> ???

<hr />

### Python

1. Both apps are written in Python and run within a <strong>Docker Container</strong> orchestrated as a pod within the <a href="Kubernetes">Kubernetes container orchestrator</a>.

   Both apps make API calls to two AI (Artificial Intelligence) services pretending to be human:

   ### OpenAI Service

1. The [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) uses the "ChatGPT-3.5" version of OpenAI's LLM (Large Language Model) that became famous in 2023 for its ability to <strong>generate</strong> new content based on existing content. LLMs also enable [content summarization](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-summarize-a-book-article-or-research-paper/), semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or  the web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.

   This is made possible by [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) like OpenAI ChatGPT, which are deep learning algorithms capable of recognizing, summarizing, translating, predicting, and generating text and other content. LLMs leverage the knowledge acquired from extensive datasets, enabling them to perform tasks that go beyond teaching AI human languages. These models have found success in diverse domains, including understanding proteins, writing software code, and more. Apart from their applications in natural language processing, such as translation, chatbots, and AI assistants, large language models are also extensively employed in healthcare, software development, and various other fields.

   The OpenAI platform services provide "cognitive services" powered by models created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). One of the models available through this service is the [ChatGPT-4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-models) 

   Azure OpenAI Service listens for responds to REST API access to several of OpenAI's language models:
   * [GPT-3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-3-models), 
   * [Codex](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#codex-models) 
   * [Embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#codex-models)
   * [GPT-4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-models) is designed for interactive conversational tasks. It allows developers to integrate natural language understanding and generation capabilities into their applications.
   * [ChatGPT-35 Turbo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo)
   <br /><br /> 

   The [Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) of the Azure OpenAI Service provides a dedicated interface for interacting with the [ChatGPT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo) and [GPT-4 models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-models). This API is currently in preview and is the preferred method for accessing these models. The GPT-4 models can only be accessed through this API.

   ### Prompts
   
   [GPT-3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-3-models), [GPT-3.5](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo), and [GPT-4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#gpt-4-models) models from OpenAI are prompt-based. With prompt-based models, the user interacts with the model by entering a text prompt, to which the model responds with a text completion. This completion is the model’s continuation of the input text. While these models are extremely powerful, their behavior is also very sensitive to the prompt. This makes prompt construction an important skill to develop. For more information, see [Introduction to prompt engineering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering).

   Prompt construction can be difficult. In practice, the prompt acts to configure the model weights to complete the desired task, but it's more of an art than a science, often requiring experience and intuition to craft a successful prompt. The goal of this article is to help get you started with this learning process. It attempts to capture general concepts and patterns that apply to all GPT models. However it's important to understand that each model behaves differently, so the learnings may not apply equally to all models.

   Prompt engineering refers to the process of creating instructions called prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT. With the immense potential of LLMs to solve a wide range of tasks, leveraging prompt engineering can empower us to save significant time and facilitate the development of impressive applications. It holds the key to unleashing the full capabilities of these huge models, transforming how we interact and benefit from them. For more information, see [Prompt engineering techniques](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions).

   For more about the Azure OpenAI Service and Large Language Models (LLMs), see:

   - [What is Azure OpenAI Service?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview)
   - [Azure OpenAI Service models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models)
   - [Large Language Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model)
   <br /><br />


   ### Chainlit

2. The <strong>Chainlit service</strong> creates ChatGPT-like user interfaces (UIs) for AI applications. 
   
   Chainlit is an open-source Python package based on the "Streamlit" general-purpose UI library, but purpose-built for AI applications to enable conversational experiences and information retrieval. 

   Chainlit can uniquely trace its [Chain of Thought](https://docs.chainlit.io/concepts/chain-of-thought), which allows users to explore the reasoning process directly within the UI. This feature enhances transparency and enables users to understand how the AI arrives at its responses or recommendations.

   Chainlit seamlessly integrates with other AI technologies such as <a href="#LangChain">LangChain (described below)</a>, [LlamaIndex](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [LangFlow](https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow).

   For more information about Chainlit, see these resources:

   - [Introduction](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html)
   - [Documentation](https://docs.chainlit.io/overview)
   - [Examples](https://docs.chainlit.io/examples/community)
   - [API Reference](https://docs.chainlit.io/api-reference/on-message)
   - [Cookbook](https://docs.chainlit.io/examples/cookbook)
   <br /><br />

   The "Docs Application" container setup and run by this repo additionally contains an instance of the LangChain and <a href="#ChromaDB">"ChromaDB"</a>  <a href="#Vector=Databases">Vector Database</a>.

   ### LangChain

1. LangChain is a language model integration framework designed to streamline the development of applications using [large language models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model). 
   
   LangChain facilitates applications such as document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.

   LangChain's integrations cover an extensive range of systems, tools, and services, making it a comprehensive solution for language model-based applications. LangChain integrates with the major cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google, and with API wrappers for various purposes like news, movie information, and weather, as well as support for Bash, web scraping, and more. It also supports multiple language models, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face. Moreover, LangChain offers various functionalities for document handling, code generation, analysis, debugging, and interaction with databases and other data sources.

   ### ChromaDB

1. A [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/memories/vector-db) is a specialized database that goes beyond traditional storage by organizing information to simplify the search for similar items. Instead of merely storing words or numbers, it leverages vector embeddings - unique numerical representations of data. These embeddings capture meaning, context, and relationships. For instance, words are represented as vectors, whereas similar words have similar vector values.

   The applications of vector databases are numerous and powerful. In language processing, they facilitate the discovery of related documents or sentences. By comparing the vector embeddings of different texts, finding similar or related information becomes faster and more efficient. This capability benefits search engines and recommendation systems, which can suggest relevant articles or products based on user interests.

   In the realm of image analysis, vector databases excel in finding visually similar images. By representing images as vectors, a simple comparison of vector values can identify visually similar images. This capability is highly valuable for tasks like reverse image search or content-based image retrieval.

   Additionally, vector databases find applications in fraud detection, anomaly detection, and clustering. By comparing vector embeddings of data points, unusual patterns can be detected, and similar items can be grouped together, aiding in effective data analysis and decision-making.

   This sample makes of the [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) vector database, but you can easily modify the code to use another vector database. You can even use [Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) to store the vector embeddings and compute vector similarity with high performance and low latency. For more information, see [Vector Similarity Search with Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-developer-community-blog/vector-similarity-search-with-azure-cache-for-redis-enterprise/ba-p/3822059)

   [ChromaDB](https://docs.trychroma.com/) stores and retrieves <strong>vector embeddings</strong> to add private data to LLMs. It is commonly used in AI applications, including chatbots and document analysis systems. By storing embeddings in ChromaDB, users can easily search and retrieve similar vectors, enabling faster and more accurate matching or recommendation processes. ChromaDB offers excellent scalability high performance, and supports various indexing techniques to optimize search operations. It is a versatile tool that enhances the functionality and efficiency of AI applications that rely on vector embeddings.<hr />

## Build Custom Docker Containers into ACR

The [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/container_registry) is used to build, store, and manage container images and other artefacts in a private registry for deployments to Kubernetes. See https://wilsonmar.github.io/kubernetes

   <ul><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bomonike/azure-chatgbt/tree/main/scripts/Dockerfile">https://github.com/bomonike/azure-chatgbt/tree/main/scripts/Dockerfile</a> 
   </ul>

1. Ensure that the Docker client is running.

1. Review the Dockerfile (at time of this writing, the file's contents):

   ```bash
# app/Dockerfile

# # Stage 1 - Install build dependencies

# A Dockerfile must start with a FROM instruction which sets the base image for the container.
# The Python images come in many flavors, each designed for a specific use case.
# The python:3.11-slim image is a good base image for most applications.
# It is a minimal image built on top of Debian Linux and includes only the necessary packages to run Python.
# The slim image is a good choice because it is small and contains only the packages needed to run Python.
# For more information, see: 
# * https://hub.docker.com/_/python 
# * https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/deploy/docker
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder

# The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
# If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.
# For more information, see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir
WORKDIR /app

# Set environment variables. 
# The ENV instruction sets the environment variable <key> to the value <value>.

# Install git so that we can clone the app code from a remote repo using the RUN instruction.
# The RUN comand has 2 forms:
# * RUN <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is /bin/sh -c on Linux or cmd /S /C on Windows)
# * RUN ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
# The RUN instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 
# The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.

## Build Kubernetes

   The containers are retrieved by the
   [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) built upon the open-source Kubernetes framework from Google.

   To continue running with a cluster of containers when another one fails, Kubernetes runs several clusters, each  consists of the same set of "pods":

   Each cluster communicates with the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) via an [Azure Private Endpoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview). 

   - [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/kubernetes_cluster):  A public or private [Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) cluster composed of a:
   - A `system` node pool in a dedicated subnet. The default node pool hosts only critical system pods and services. The worker nodes have node taint which prevents application pods from beings scheduled on this node pool.
   - A `user` node pool hosting user workloads and artifacts in a dedicated subnet.

[Azure Managed Grafana](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/dashboard_grafana): an [Azure Managed Grafana](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) instance used to visualize the [Prometheus metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/containers/prometheus-metrics-enable?tabs=azure-portal) generated by the [Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) cluster deployed by the Bicep modules. [Azure Managed Grafana](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview) is a fully managed service for analytics and monitoring solutions. It's supported by Grafana Enterprise, which provides extensible data visualizations. This managed service allows to quickly and easily deploy Grafana dashboards with built-in high availability and control access with Azure security.

1. [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): the AKS cluster is configured to collect metrics to the [Azure Monitor workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview) and [Azure Managed Grafana](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/managed-grafana/overview). Nonetheless, the [kube-prometheus-stack](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack) Helm chart is used to install [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) on the AKS cluster.

1. [Azure Log Analytics Workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/log_analytics_workspace): a centralized [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-workspace-overview) workspace is used to collect the diagnostics logs and metrics from all the Azure resources:
   - Azure OpenAI Service
   - Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
   - Azure Key Vault
   - Azure Network Security Group
   - Azure Container Registry
   - Azure Storage Account
   - Azure jump-box virtual machine
   <br /><br />

   ### Compute

1. [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/): this sample compares the managed and unmanaged NGINX Ingress Controller. While the managed version is installed using the [Application routing add-on](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/app-routing), the unmanaged version is deployed using the [Helm Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/helm/latest/docs). You can use the Helm provider to deploy software packages in Kubernetes. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

1. [Azure Virtual Machine](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_virtual_machine): Terraform modules can optionally create a jump-box virtual machine to manage the private AKS cluster.


> **NOTE**  
> In a production environment, we strongly recommend deploying a [private AKS cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters) with [Uptime SLA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/uptime-sla). For more information, see [private AKS cluster with a Public DNS address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters#create-a-private-aks-cluster-with-a-public-dns-address). Alternatively, you can deploy a public AKS cluster and secure access to the API server using [authorized IP address ranges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/api-server-authorized-ip-ranges).

## Run Terraform

The repo provides a template show how to deploy an [Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) cluster and [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) modules with the [Azure Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) Terraform Provider and how to deploy a Python chatbot that authenticates against Azure OpenAI using [Azure AD workload identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and calls the [Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) of a [ChatGPT model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo). For a Bicep version of the demo, see [How to deploy and run an Azure OpenAI ChatGPT application on AKS via Bicep](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aks-openai).

In a production environment, we strongly recommend deploying a [private AKS cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters) with [Uptime SLA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/uptime-sla). For more information, see [private AKS cluster with a Public DNS address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/private-clusters#create-a-private-aks-cluster-with-a-public-dns-address). Alternatively, you can deploy a public AKS cluster and secure access to the API server using [authorized IP address ranges](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/api-server-authorized-ip-ranges).


Before deploying the Terraform modules in the `terraform` folder, 

1. Specify a value for the variables in this file:

   [terraform.tfvars](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) 

   ```terraform
name_prefix            = "magic8ball"
domain                 = "contoso.com"
subdomain              = "magic"
namespace              = "magic8ball"
service_account_name   = "magic8ball-sa"
ssh_public_key         = "XXXXXXX"
vm_enabled             = true
location               = "westeurope"
admin_group_object_ids = ["XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"] 
   ```

   **Description**

   - `prefix`: specifies a prefix for all the Azure resources.

   - `domain`: specifies the domain part (e.g., subdomain.domain) of the hostname of the ingress object used to expose the chatbot via the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/).

   - `subdomain`: specifies the subdomain part of the hostname of the ingress object used to expose the chatbot via the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/).

   - `namespace`: specifies the namespace of the workload application that accesses the Azure OpenAI Service.

   - `service_account_name`: specifies the name of the service account of the workload application that accesses the Azure OpenAI Service.

   - `ssh_public_key`: specifies the SSH public key used for the AKS nodes and jumpbox virtual machine.

   - `vm_enabled`: a boleean value that specifies whether deploying or not a jumpbox virtual machine in the same virtual network of the AKS cluster.

   - `location`: specifies the region (e.g., westeurope) where deploying the Azure resources.

   - `admin_group_object_ids`: when deploying an AKS cluster with Azure AD and Azure RBAC integration, this array parameter contains the list of Azure AD group object IDs that will have the admin role of the cluster.

Before proceeding, also make sure to run the `register-preview-features.sh` Bash script in the `terraform` folder to register any preview feature used by the AKS cluster.


### openai.tf

The following table contains the code from the `openai.tf` Terraform module used to deploy the [Azure OpenAI Service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cognitive_account).

```terraform

  log_analytics_workspace_id = var.log_analytics_workspace_id

  enabled_log {
    category = "Audit"

    retention_policy {
      enabled = true
      days    = var.log_analytics_retention_days
    }
  }

  enabled_log {
    category = "RequestResponse"

    retention_policy {

      days    = var.log_analytics_retention_days
    }
  }
}
```

Azure Cognitive Services use custom subdomain names for each resource created through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/cloud-shell/), [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), [Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview), [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview), or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cognitive_account). Unlike regional endpoints, which were common for all customers in a specific Azure region, custom subdomain names are unique to the resource. Custom subdomain names are required to enable features like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication. In our case, we need to specify a custom subdomain for our [Azure OpenAI Service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cognitive_account) as our chatbot application will use an Azure AD security token to access it. By default, the `main.tf` module sets the value of the `custom_subdomain_name` parameter to the lowercase name of the Azure OpenAI resource. For more information on custom subdomains, see [Custom subdomain names for Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-custom-subdomains?source=docs).

This terraform module allows you to pass an array containing the definition of one or more model deployments in the `deployments` parameter. For more information on model deployments, see [Create a resource and deploy a model using Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

As an alternative, you can use the [Terraform module for deploying Azure OpenAI Service.](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Azure/openai/azurerm/latest) to deploy an [Azure OpenAI Service](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cognitive_account).



Below you can read the code of the `private_dns_zone` and `private_endpoint` modules used, respectively, to create the [Azure Private Endpoints](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/private_endpoint) and [Azure Private DNDS Zones](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/data-sources/private_dns_zone).

**private_dns_zone**

```terraform
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "private_dns_zone" {
  name                = var.name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  tags                = var.tags

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags
    ]
  }
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "link" {
  for_each = var.virtual_networks_to_link

  name                  = "link_to_${lower(basename(each.key))}"
  resource_group_name   = var.resource_group_name
  private_dns_zone_name = azurerm_private_dns_zone.private_dns_zone.name
  virtual_network_id    = "/subscriptions/${each.value.subscription_id}/resourceGroups/${each.value.resource_group_name}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/${each.key}"

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags
    ]
  }
}
```

**private_endpoint**

```terraform
resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "private_endpoint" {
  name                = var.name
  location            = var.location
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  subnet_id           = var.subnet_id
  tags                = var.tags

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "${var.name}Connection"
    private_connection_resource_id = var.private_connection_resource_id
    is_manual_connection           = var.is_manual_connection
    subresource_names              = try([var.subresource_name], null)
    request_message                = try(var.request_message, null)
  }

  private_dns_zone_group {
    name                 = var.private_dns_zone_group_name
    private_dns_zone_ids = var.private_dns_zone_group_ids
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags
    ]
  }
}
```

## AKS Workload User-Defined Managed Identity

The following code snippet from the `main.tf` Terraform module creates the user-defined managed identity used by the chatbot to acquire a security token from Azure Active Directory via [Azure AD workload identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview).

```terraform
resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "aks_workload_identity" {
  name                = var.name_prefix == null ? "${random_string.prefix.result}${var.workload_managed_identity_name}" : "${var.name_prefix}${var.workload_managed_identity_name}"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  location            = var.location
  tags                = var.tags

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      tags
    ]
  }
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "cognitive_services_user_assignment" {
  scope                = module.openai.id
  role_definition_name = "Cognitive Services User"
  principal_id         = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.aks_workload_identity.principal_id
  skip_service_principal_aad_check = true
}

resource "azurerm_federated_identity_credential" "federated_identity_credential" {
  name                = "${title(var.namespace)}FederatedIdentity"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  audience            = ["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]
  issuer              = module.aks_cluster.oidc_issuer_url
  parent_id           = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.aks_workload_identity.id
  subject             = "system:serviceaccount:${var.namespace}:${var.service_account_name}"
}
```

The above code snippet performs the following steps:

- Creates a new user-defined managed identity.
- Assign the new managed identity to the Cognitive Services User role with the resource group as a scope.
- Federate the managed identity with the service account used by the chatbot. The following information is necessary to create the federated identity credentials:
  - The Kubernetes service account name.
  - The Kubernetes namespace that will host the chatbot application.
  - The URL of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) token issuer endpoint for [Azure AD workload identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)

For more information, see the following resources:

- [How to configure Azure OpenAI Service with managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity)
- [Use Azure AD workload identity with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)

## Validate the deployment

Open the Azure Portal, and navigate to the resource group. Open the Azure Open AI Service resource, navigate to `Keys and Endpoint`, and check that the endpoint contains a custom subdomain rather than the regional Cognitive Services endpoint.

Open to the `<Prefix>WorkloadManagedIdentity` managed identity, navigate to the `Federated credentials`, and verify that the federated identity credentials for the `magic8ball-sa` service account were created correctly, as shown in the following picture.

<a target="_blank" href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708723967/openai/federatedidentitycredentials.png"><img alt="Federated Identity Credentials" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dcajqrroq/image/upload/v1708723967/openai/federatedidentitycredentials.png"></a>


## Use Azure AD workload identity with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Workloads deployed on an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) cluster require Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application credentials or managed identities to access Azure AD protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault and Microsoft Graph. Azure AD workload identity integrates with the capabilities native to Kubernetes to federate with external identity providers.

[Azure AD workload identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/workload-identities-overview) uses [Service Account Token Volume Projection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#serviceaccount-token-volume-projection) to enable pods to use a Kubernetes service account. When enabled, the [AKS OIDC Issuer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-oidc-issuer) issues a service account security token to a workload and [OIDC federation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens) enables the application to access Azure resources securely with Azure AD based on annotated service accounts.

Azure AD workload identity works well with the [Azure Identity client libraries](#azure-identity-client-libraries) and the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview) collection if you use a [registered application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/application-model#register-an-application) instead of a managed identity. Your workload can use any of these libraries to seamlessly authenticate and access Azure cloud resources.

## Azure Identity client libraries

In the Azure Identity client libraries, you can choose one of the following approaches:

- Use `DefaultAzureCredential`, which will attempt to use the `WorkloadIdentityCredential`.
- Create a `ChainedTokenCredential` instance that includes `WorkloadIdentityCredential`.
- Use `WorkloadIdentityCredential` directly.

## Deployment Script

The sample makes use of a [Deployment Script](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/resource_deployment_script_azure_cli) to run the `install-nginx-via-helm-and-create-sa.sh` Bash script that creates the namespace and service account for the sample application and installs the following packages to the AKS cluster via [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

- [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/)
- [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)

This sample uses the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/) to expose the chatbot to the public internet.

The `install-nginx-via-helm-and-create-sa.sh` Bash script can run on a public AKS cluster or on a private AKS cluster using the [az aks command invoke](<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks/command?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-command-invoke>). For more information, see [Use command invoke to access a private Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/command-invoke).

The `install-nginx-via-helm-and-create-sa.sh` Bash script returns the following outputs to the deployment script:

- Namespace hosting the chatbot sample. You can change the default `magic8ball` namespace by assigning a different value to the `namespace` variable in the `terraform.tfvars` file.
- Service account name
- Prometheus namespace
- Cert-manager namespace
- NGINX ingress controller namespace

You can find the `install-nginx-via-helm-and-create-sa.sh` file under the `terraform` folder.

## Chatbot Application

The chatbot is a Python application inspired by the sample code in the [It’s Time To Create A Private ChatGPT For Yourself Today](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/its-time-to-create-a-private-chatgpt-for-yourself-today-6503649e7bb6) arctiel. The application is contained in a single file called `app.py`. The application makes use of the following libraries:

- [OpenAPI](https://github.com/openai/openai-python): The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API. You can find usage examples for the OpenAI Python library in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference?lang=python) and the [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/).
- [Azure Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-python): The Azure Identity library provides [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) token authentication support across the Azure SDK. It provides a set of [TokenCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-core/azure.core.credentials.tokencredential?view=azure-python) implementations, which can be used to construct Azure SDK clients that support Azure AD token authentication.
- [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit): Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps. For more information, see [Streamlit documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)
- [Streamlit-chat](https://github.com/AI-Yash/st-chat): a Streamlit component that provides a configurable user interface for chatbot applications.
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv): Python-dotenv reads key-value pairs from a .env file and can set them as environment variables. It helps in the development of applications following the [12-factor](http://12factor.net/) principles.

The `requirements.txt` file under the `scripts` folder contains the list of packages used by the `app.py` application that you can restore using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

The following table contains the code of the `app.py` chatbot:

```python

## Working with the ChatGPT and GPT-4 models

The `generate_response` function creates and sends the prompt to the [Chat Completion API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) of the [ChatGPT model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#chatgpt-gpt-35-turbo).

```python
def generate_response(prompt):
  try:
    st.session_state['prompts'].append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})

    if openai.api_type == "azure_ad":
      refresh_openai_token()

    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      engine = engine,
      model = model,
      messages = st.session_state['prompts'],
      temperature = temperature,
    )
    
    message = completion.choices[0].message.content
    return message
  except Exception as e:
    logging.exception(f"Exception in generate_response: {e}")
```

OpenAI trained the ChatGPT and GPT-4 models to accept input formatted as a conversation. The messages parameter takes an array of dictionaries with a conversation organized by role or message: system, user, and assistant. The format of a basic Chat Completion is as follows:

```json
{"role": "system", "content": "Provide some context and/or instructions to the model"},
{"role": "user", "content": "The users messages goes here"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The response message goes here."}
```

The `system` role also known as the system message is included at the beginning of the array. This message provides the initial instructions to the model. You can provide various information in the system role including:

- A brief description of the assistant
- Personality traits of the assistant
- Instructions or rules you would like the assistant to follow
- Data or information needed for the model, such as relevant questions from an FAQ
- You can customize the system role for your use case or just include basic instructions.

The `system` role or message is optional, but it's recommended to at least include a basic one to get the best results. The `user` role or message represents an input or inquiry from the user, while the `assistant` message corresponds to the response generated by the GPT API. This dialog exchange aims to simulate a human-like conversation, where the user message initiates the interaction and the assistant message provides a relevant and informative answer. This context helps the chat model generate a more appropriate response later on. The last user message refers to the prompt currently requested.  For more information, see [Learn how to work with the ChatGPT and GPT-4 models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/chatgpt?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions).

<hr />

## Application Configuration

Make sure to provide a value for the following environment variables when testing the `app.py` Python app locally, for example in Visual Studio Code. You can eventually define environment variables in a `.env` file in the same folder as the `app.py` file.

- `AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE`: specify `azure` if you want to let the application use the API key to authenticate against OpenAI. In this case, make sure to provide the Key in the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable. If you want to authenticate using an Azure AD security token, you need to specify `azure_ad` as a value. In this case, don't need to provide any value in the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE`: the URL of your Azure OpenAI resource. If you use the API key to authenticate against OpenAI, you can specify the regional endpoint of your Azure OpenAI Service (e.g., [https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/](https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/)). If you instead plan to use Azure AD security tokens for authentication, you need to deploy your Azure OpenAI Service with a subdomain and specify the resource-specific endpoint url (e.g., [https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/](https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/)).
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: the key of your Azure OpenAI resource.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`: the name of the ChatGPT deployment used by your Azure OpenAI resource, for example `gpt-35-turbo`.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL`: the name of the ChatGPT model used by your Azure OpenAI resource, for example `gpt-35-turbo`.
- `TITLE`: the title of the Streamlit app.
- `TEMPERATURE`: the temperature used by the OpenAI API to generate the response.
- `SYSTEM`: give the model instructions about how it should behave and any context it should reference when generating a response. Used to describe the assistant's personality.

When deploying the application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) these values are provided in a Kubernetes [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/). For more information, see the next section.

<hr />

## OpenAI Library

In order to use the `openai` library with Microsoft Azure endpoints, you need to set the `api_type`, `api_base` and `api_version` in addition to the `api_key`. The `api_type` must be set to 'azure' and the others correspond to the properties of your endpoint. In addition, the deployment name must be passed as the engine parameter. In order to use OpenAI Key to authenticate to your Azure endpoint, you need to set the `api_type` to `azure` and pass the OpenAI Key to `api_key`.

```python
import openai
openai.api_type = "azure"
openai.api_key = "..."
openai.api_base = "https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"

# create a chat completion
chat_completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(deployment_id="gpt-3.5-turbo", model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}])

# print the completion
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

For a detailed example of how to use fine-tuning and other operations using Azure endpoints, please check out the following Jupyter notebooks:

- [Using Azure completions](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/azure/completions.ipynb)
- [Using Azure fine-tuning](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/azure/finetuning.ipynb)
- [Using Azure embeddings](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/azure/embeddings.ipynb)

In order to use Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate to your Azure endpoint, you need to set the `api_type` to `azure_ad` and pass the acquired credential token to `api_key`. The rest of the parameters need to be set as specified in the previous section.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
import openai

# Request credential
default_credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
token = default_credential.get_token("https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default")

# Setup parameters
openai.api_type = "azure_ad"
openai.api_key = token.token
openai.api_base = "https://example-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
openai.api_version = "2023-05-15"

# ...
```

<hr />

## App auth methods

Two different authentication methods in the `magic8ball` chatbot application:

- `API key`: set the `AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE` environment variable to `azure` and the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable to the key of your Azure OpenAI resource. You can use the regional endpoint, such as [https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/](https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/), in the `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE` environment variable, to connect to the Azure OpenAI resource.

- `Azure Active Directory`: set the `AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE` environment variable to `azure_ad` and use a service principal or managed identity with the [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-identity/azure.identity.defaultazurecredential?view=azure-python) object to acquire a security token from Azure Active Directory. For more information on the DefaultAzureCredential in Python, see [Authenticate Python apps to Azure services by using the Azure SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-authenticate?tabs=cmd). Make sure to assign the `Cognitive Services User` role to the service principal or managed identity used to authenticate to your Azure OpenAI Service. For more information, see [How to configure Azure OpenAI Service with managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/managed-identity). If you want to use Azure AD integrated security, you need to create a custom subdomain for your Azure OpenAI resource and use the specific endpoint containing the custom domain, such as [https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/](https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/) where myopenai is the custom subdomain. If you specify the regional endpoint, you get an error like the following: `Subdomain does not map to a resource`. Hence, pass the custom domain endpoint in the `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE` environment variable. In this case, you also need to refresh the security token periodically.

## Run Deployment Scripts

There are two

   * Terraform
   * AKS
   <br /><br />

If you deployed the Azure infrastructure using the Terraform modules provided with this sample, you only need to deploy the application using the following scripts and YAML templates in the `scripts` folder.

**YAML manifests**

- `configMap.yml`
- `deployment.yml`
- `ingress.yml`
- `service.yml`

**Scripts**

- `09-deploy-app.sh`
- `10-create-ingress.sh`
- `11-configure-dns.sh`

Alternately, to deploy the application in your AKS cluster, you can use the following scripts to configure your environment.

<hr />

### 04-create-nginx-ingress-controller.sh

The scripts used to deploy the YAML template use the [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) tool to customize the manifests with the value of the variables defined in the `00-variables.sh` file. This tool is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML, JSON and XML processor that uses [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) like syntax but works with YAML files as well as json, xml, properties, csv and tsv. It doesn't yet support everything jq does - but it does support the most common operations and functions, and more is being added continuously.

<hr />

### YAML manifests

Below you can read the YAML manifests used to deploy the `magic8ball` chatbot to AKS.

**configmap.yml**
The `configmap.yml` defines a value for the environment variables passed to the application container. The configmap does not define any environment variable for the OpenAI key as the container.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: magic8ball-configmap
data:
  TITLE: "Magic 8 Ball"
  LABEL: "Pose your question and cross your fingers!"
  TEMPERATURE: "0.9"
  IMAGE_WIDTH: "80"
  AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE: azure_ad
  AZURE_OPENAI_BASE: https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/
  AZURE_OPENAI_KEY: ""
  AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL: gpt-35-turbo
  AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT: magic8ballGPT
```

These are the parameters defined by the configmap:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE`: specify `azure` if you want to let the application use the API key to authenticate against OpenAI. In this case, make sure to provide the Key in the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable. If you want to authenticate using an Azure AD security token, you need to specify `azure_ad` as a value. In this case, don't need to provide any value in the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` environment variable.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_BASE`: the URL of your Azure OpenAI resource. If you use the API key to authenticate against OpenAI, you can specify the regional endpoint of your Azure OpenAI Service (e.g., [https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/](https://eastus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/)). If you instead plan to use Azure AD security tokens for authentication, you need to deploy your Azure OpenAI Service with a subdomain and specify the resource-specific endpoint url (e.g., [https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/](https://myopenai.openai.azure.com/)).
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`: the key of your Azure OpenAI resource. If you set `AZURE_OPENAI_TYPE` to `azure_ad` you can leave this parameter empty.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`: the name of the ChatGPT deployment used by your Azure OpenAI resource, for example `gpt-35-turbo`.
- `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL`: the name of the ChatGPT model used by your Azure OpenAI resource, for example `gpt-35-turbo`.
- `TITLE`: the title of the Streamlit app.
- `TEMPERATURE`: the temperature used by the OpenAI API to generate the response.
- `SYSTEM`: give the model instructions about how it should behave and any context it should reference when generating a response. Used to describe the assistant's personality.




### chat-deployment.yml

The `deployment.yml` manifest is used create a Kubernetes [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) that defines the application pods to create. [azure.workload.identity/use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview#pod-labels) label is required in the pod template spec. Only pods with this label will be mutated by the azure-workload-identity mutating admission webhook to inject the Azure specific environment variables and the projected service account token volume.

### ../scripts/service.yml

The application is exposed using a `ClusterIP` Kubernetes [service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: magic8ball
  labels:
    app: magic8ball
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8501
  selector:
    app: magic8ball
```

## ingress.yml

The `ingress.yml` manifest defines a Kubernetes [ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) object used to expose the service via the [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/).

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: magic8ball-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-nginx
    cert-manager.io/acme-challenge-type: http01 
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout: "360"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout: "360"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "360"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-next-upstream-timeout: "360"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
      more_set_headers "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN";
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - magic8ball.contoso.com
    secretName: tls-secret
  rules:
  - host: magic8ball.contoso.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: magic8ball
            port:
              number: 8501
```

The ingress object defines the following annotations:

- [cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/#supported-annotations): specifies the name of a cert-manager.io ClusterIssuer to acquire the certificate required for this Ingress. It does not matter which namespace your Ingress resides, as ClusterIssuers are non-namespaced resources. In this sample, the cert-manager is instructed to use the `letsencrypt-nginx` ClusterIssuer that you can create using the `06-create-cluster-issuer.sh` script.
- [cert-manager.io/acme-challenge-type](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/#supported-annotations): specifies the challend type.
- [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-connect-timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#custom-timeouts): specifies the connection timeout in seconds.
- [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-send-timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#custom-timeouts): specifies the send timeout in seconds.
- [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#custom-timeouts): specifies the read timeout in seconds.
- [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-next-upstream-timeout](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#custom-timeouts): specifies the next upstream timeout in seconds.
- [nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blob/main/docs/user-guide/nginx-configuration/annotations.md#configuration-snippet): allows additional configuration to the NGINX location.

## Review deployed resources

Use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to list the deployed resources in the resource group.

1. Review

   ```azurecli
az resource list --resource-group "${RESC_GROUP_NAME}"
   ```

   Alternately:

   ```azurepowershell
Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName "${RESC_GROUP_NAME}"
   ```

## Clean up resources

When you no longer need the resources you created, just delete the resource group. This will remove all the Azure resources.

1. Using Azure CLI

   ```azurecli
az group delete --name "${RESC_GROUP_NAME}"
   ```
   Alternately, 

   ```azurepowershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "${RESC_GROUP_NAME}"
   ```

END
